For key concerns we had to remove our key but you can put yours on this line: 

```
YOUR_API_KEY = (insert key here)
``` 
To install the required dependencies:

```
$ pip install streamlit openai PyPDF2
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run our application with:

```
$ streamlit run math_notes_assistant.py
```
